# Project 0

This is the project 0 of the course - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript by CS50.

With a total of four html and one css stylesheet, I build this "website" with the design from a free template example named 'album' by Bootstrap".

As I have done a similar assignment for another online course, this page is actually built based on that previous one.  Therefore, most things are similar but there are also something different which are mostly the extra requirements for this project.
